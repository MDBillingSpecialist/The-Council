<p><strong>Phased Progression</strong>
- The game progresses through distinct phases: Reactivation (basic collection and repairs), Expansion (infrastructure projects and advancements), and Legacy (restoring societal functions).
- <strong>Example:</strong> Each phase unlocks new abilities and technologies corresponding to the empire's rebuilding stages.</p>
<p><strong>Task and Efficiency Management</strong>
- <strong>Task Assignment:</strong> Prioritize tasks to maximize efficiency, such as focusing on metal scrap collection for upgrading robots.
